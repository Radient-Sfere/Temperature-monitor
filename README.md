# Temperature-monitor
V0.9, we've finally handled arduino input, however, i need to test this for bugs, which'll take setting up.
Configuration:
pins 0-10 as LED outputs, pin a0 as temperature sensor, and a switch, everything being converted to binary.

In future updates:
  -Optimization by getting rid of binswitch and G_TMP with values direct from reading
  -Styling & Formatting
  -Full on, raw no rubber arduino compatability
